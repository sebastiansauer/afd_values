What drives AfD election success?


The party "Alternative fuer Deutschland" (AfD) is a novel party 
that has managed to gain seats in all states parliaments as well as in the federal parliament. 
Such striking success in quite unique in German post-war politics.
Such grand scales changes has sparked a considerably debate as to the why and hows. 
A number of causes has been brought forward both by scholars but also some "folk theories" circulate. 
In this talk, we test some folk models including structural factors such as unemployment, migration rate, age, and east/west differences. 
Our study is novel insofar as a more rigorous bayesian multilevel modeling is applied. In addition, we include large-scale personality data (n = 22,000) which was not available for previous study.
Our result provide little evidence for the validity of typical folk theories. 
We interpret the data that such theories should be abandoned. 
Moreover, personality trait did not explain much election behavior either. 
Explanation for this finding are discussed alongside with recommendations for future research.
