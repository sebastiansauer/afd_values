What drives AfD election success?


The party "Alternative fuer Deutschland" (AfD) is a right-wing to far-right political party in Germany.
Founded in 2013, it that has managed to gain seats in all states parliaments as well as in the federal parliament
within a short period of time. 
The AfD became the third-largest party in Germany after the 2017 federal elections.
Such striking success in quite unique in German post-war politics.
Consequently, AfD's upsurge has sparked an intensive debate as to the why and hows 
of this success. 
Some explanations of AfD's electoral success has been brought forward by scholars 
but also some "folk theories" circulate. 
In this talk, we test some folk theories highlighting potential causes of AfD electoral success 
such as unemployment, migration rate, age, and east/west cultural differences. 
Our data are based on the German federal election results (2017), alongside with structural data 
on each German electoral district (n=299).
Our analysis is novel insofar as a more rigorous Bayesian multilevel modeling is applied. 
In addition, we include large-scale human behavioral data (n = 22,000) 
which was not available in previous studies.
In sum, our result provide little evidence for the validity of typical folk theories. 
We interpret the results that such folk theories should be abandoned. 
Moreover, value driven human behavior trait did not explain much election behavior either. 
It appears that voting success, particularly with regard to the AfD, is still far from begin understood properly.
Explanation for this finding are discussed alongside with recommendations for future research.
