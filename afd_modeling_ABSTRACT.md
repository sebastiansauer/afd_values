What drives AfD election success?


The party "Alternative fuer Deutschland" (AfD) is a novel party in German politics
that has managed to gain seats in all states parliaments as well as in the federal parliament. 
Such striking success in quite unique in German post-war politics.
AfD's upsurge has sparked an intensive debate as to the why and hows. 
A number of causes to explain AfD's success has been brought forward both by scholars 
but also some "folk theories" circulate. 
In this talk, we test some folk theories highlighting potential causes of AfD success 
such as unemployment, migration rate, age, and east/west cultural differences. 
Our study is novel insofar as a more rigorous bayesian multilevel modeling is applied. 
In addition, we include large-scale human behavioral data (n = 22,000) 
which was not available in previous studies.
Our result provide little evidence for the validity of typical folk theories. 
We interpret the results that such folk theories should be abandoned. 
Moreover, value driven human behaviour trait did not explain much election behavior either. 
It appears that voting success, particularly to the AfD, is still far from begin understood properly.
Explanation for this finding are discussed alongside with recommendations for future research.
